/**
 * This class is one of the two possible driver algorithms that the user may select
 * to run an automated game.
 * Wizard implements Robot Driver.
 * RobotDriver works together with Robot to automatically move the robot through
 * the maze with the intention of solving it.
 * RobotDriver also gets its maze information from Maze.
 *  
 * Wizard attempts to get out of the maze as quickly as possible by using the
 * information from the Maze's setMaze to determine where to move in order to 
 * get to the exit. Because of this, it also does not need to use a sensor to
 * decide what to do, but it must not drive into a wall. This serves as a
 * baseline algorithm to see how efficiently algorithms can perform in terms 
 * of energy consumption and path length. (from Project 3 directions)
