/**
 * This class is one of the two possible driver algorithms that the user may select
 * to run an automated game.
 * WallFollower implements Robot Driver.
 * RobotDriver works together with Robot to automatically move the robot through
 * the maze with the intention of solving it.
 * RobotDriver also gets its maze information from Maze.
 *  
 * WallFollower attempts to cling to the left edge of the maze in order to 
 * eventually find the exit. It relies on its sensors to determine where the walls
 * are in order to turn and follow them whenever possible.
 * 
 * Unlike Wizard, this is not an efficient algorithm.
